Day 1
"The tree become taller"
The girl write it down in her notebook, with a <b> BIG BIG </b> smile on her face.
Hey, little tree, you must grow up taller and taller so that I can one day climb up on you and sleep!
(Well, that's certainly not happening very soon)
OK. Let me give you some water so that you can grow strong and tall!
